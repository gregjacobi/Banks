## 🧪 Complete Test Scenario

### Test: Strong Credit (Both Agree)

**Conversation 1:**
```
Create a demo credit memo for TechParts Inc:
- $3M equipment loan
- Private company
- $20M revenue, EBITDA $3.5M
- Existing debt $2M
Use realistic demo data for a strong credit profile.
```

**Conversation 2:**
```
Review this credit memo as an independent analyst:
[Paste memo from Conversation 1]
```

**Expected:**
- Banker: APPROVED
- Analyst: CONCUR (may add minor conditions)

---

### Test: Weak Credit (Analyst Declines)

**Conversation 1:**
```
Create demo credit memo for ABC Manufacturing:
- $10M term loan
- Company has EBITDA $1.8M
- Existing debt service $1.2M/year
Use realistic data.
```

This creates DSCR around 1.15x (below 1.25x minimum)

**Conversation 2:**

Review this credit memo as an analyst.
[Paste memo]
```

**Expected:**
- Banker: May approve with conditions
