## Key Financial Ratios & Targets

### Liquidity Ratios

#### Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

**Target Range:** 1.2 - 2.0

**Interpretation:**
- **< 1.0**: **Red flag** - Company may struggle to meet short-term obligations
- **1.0 - 1.2**: **Caution** - Tight liquidity, monitor closely
- **1.2 - 2.0**: **Target** - Healthy liquidity cushion
- **> 3.0**: May indicate inefficient use of current assets

**Industry Variations:**
- **Retail/Service companies:** Often operate with lower ratios (1.0-1.5) due to cash business models
- **Manufacturing:** Typically need higher ratios (1.5-2.5) due to inventory and receivables cycles
- **Distribution:** Often in middle range (1.3-2.0)

---

#### Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

**Target Range:** 0.8 - 1.5

**Interpretation:**
- **< 0.5**: **Red flag** - Significant liquidity risk
- **0.5 - 0.8**: **Caution** - Monitor carefully
- **0.8 - 1.5**: **Target** - Adequate liquid assets
- **> 2.0**: Potentially excess liquidity

**When to Focus on Quick Ratio:**
- Companies with slow-moving inventory
- Industries with inventory obsolescence risk (technology, fashion)
- Seasonal businesses during off-season

---

#### Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

**Target:** Positive and adequate for business operations

**Analysis Points:**
- Compare to monthly revenue (working capital ÷ monthly revenue)
- **Rule of Thumb:** Working capital should cover 1-3 months of operating expenses
- Analyze trend: growing, stable, or declining?
- Seasonal variations normal for some businesses

**Red Flags:**
- Negative working capital (except for select cash-intensive businesses)
- Declining trend without explanation
- Working capital insufficient for planned growth

---

### Leverage Ratios

#### Debt-to-Tangible Net Worth = Total Liabilities / (Total Equity - Intangible Assets)

**Target Maximum:** 3.0x - 4.0x

**Interpretation:**
- **< 2.0x**: **Strong** - Conservative leverage
- **2.0x - 3.0x**: **Satisfactory** - Moderate leverage
- **3.0x - 4.0x**: **Acceptable** - Higher leverage, monitor closely
- **> 4.0x**: **Concern** - High leverage, requires strong cash flow and other mitigants

**Calculation Notes:**
- **Intangible Assets** to exclude: Goodwill, patents, trademarks, non-compete agreements
- **Keep:** Real estate with verified value, equipment with resale value
- Use **market values** for real estate if significantly different from book value

**Covenant Typical Structure:**
- Maximum ratio of 3.5x to 4.0x
- Tested quarterly or annually
- Cure period if violated (typically 30-60 days)

---

#### Debt-to-EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA

**Target Maximum:** 3.0x - 4.0x

**Interpretation:**
- **< 2.0x**: **Strong** - Low leverage relative to earnings
- **2.0x - 3.0x**: **Satisfactory** - Moderate leverage
- **3.0x - 4.0x**: **Acceptable** - Elevated leverage
- **> 4.0x**: **Concern** - High leverage, requires careful review
- **> 5.0x**: **Red flag** - Excessive leverage

**Calculation Notes:**
- **Total Debt** includes: All interest-bearing debt (short-term + long-term)
- **EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization
- Use **normalized EBITDA** (adjust for one-time items, owner discretionary expenses)
- Consider using **average EBITDA** over 2-3 years to smooth volatility

**Deleveraging Analysis:**
- Calculate years to pay off debt: Total Debt ÷ Annual Free Cash Flow
- Typical target: < 5 years to full deleveraging

---

#### Total Liabilities to Total Assets

**Target Maximum:** 60% (0.60)

**Interpretation:**
- **< 40%**: **Strong** - Low leverage
- **40% - 60%**: **Satisfactory** - Moderate leverage
- **60% - 70%**: **Acceptable** - Higher leverage, monitor
- **> 70%**: **Concern** - High leverage
- **> 80%**: **Red flag** - Minimal equity cushion

---

### Coverage Ratios

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

**Formula:** DSCR = EBITDA / Annual Debt Service

Where **Annual Debt Service** = Principal Payments + Interest Payments for one year

**ABSOLUTE MINIMUM: 1.25x** (Most critical underwriting threshold)

**Target Ranges:**
- **< 1.0x**: **Unacceptable** - Cannot meet debt obligations from cash flow
- **1.0x - 1.25x**: **Below Minimum** - Requires exceptional mitigants or decline
- **1.25x - 1.50x**: **Minimum Acceptable** - Little cushion, monitor closely
- **1.50x - 2.0x**: **Satisfactory** - Reasonable cushion
- **> 2.0x**: **Strong** - Comfortable cushion

**Calculation Example:**
```
EBITDA: $2,000,000
Existing Annual Debt Service: $800,000
Proposed New Annual Debt Service: $400,000
Total Pro Forma Annual Debt Service: $1,200,000

DSCR = $2,000,000 / $1,200,000 = 1.67x ✓ (Satisfactory)
```

**Important Considerations:**
- Always calculate **pro forma DSCR** including the proposed new debt
- Use **normalized EBITDA** (adjust for one-time items)
- Consider **cash taxes** not reflected in EBITDA
- Account for **owner distributions** necessary to pay taxes on pass-through entities
- Be cautious with **seasonal businesses** - may need monthly DSCR analysis

**Adjusted DSCR Calculation (More Conservative):**
```
Adjusted DSCR = (EBITDA - CapEx - Taxes - Owner Distributions) / Annual Debt Service
```

**Covenant Structure:**
- Minimum DSCR of 1.25x to 1.35x
- Tested quarterly or annually
- May test on trailing 12-month basis
- Violation triggers: Review, corrective action plan, or potential default

**When DSCR is Below 1.25x:**
- Can only approve with exceptional circumstances:
  - Very strong collateral coverage (>150%)
  - Significant personal liquidity of guarantors
  - Temporary situation with clear path to improvement
  - Substantial owner equity injection
- Require detailed cash flow projections showing improvement
- Consider smaller loan amount to improve DSCR
- Require more frequent reporting and monitoring

---

#### Interest Coverage Ratio = EBITDA / Interest Expense

**Target Minimum:** 3.0x

**Interpretation:**
- **< 1.5x**: **Red flag** - Struggling to cover interest
- **1.5x - 2.5x**: **Caution** - Limited cushion
- **2.5x - 4.0x**: **Satisfactory** - Adequate coverage
- **> 4.0x**: **Strong** - Comfortable coverage

**Analysis Points:**
- Less critical than DSCR but important for long-term viability
- Consider interest rate risk if variable rate debt
- Project impact of rate increases

---

### Profitability Ratios

#### Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue

**Target:** Varies significantly by industry

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Retail:** 20% - 40%
- **Manufacturing:** 25% - 50%
- **Software/Services:** 60% - 90%
- **Distribution:** 15% - 30%
- **Construction:** 15% - 25%

**Analysis Points:**
- Compare to industry benchmarks (use S&P, Morningstar data)
- Analyze trend: improving vs. declining
- Declining margins may signal:
  - Pricing pressure / increased competition
  - Rising input costs not passed through
  - Mix shift to lower-margin products
  - Operational inefficiencies

---

#### Operating Profit Margin = Operating Income (EBIT) / Revenue

**Target:** Varies by industry

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Retail:** 3% - 8%
- **Manufacturing:** 8% - 15%
- **Software/Services:** 15% - 30%
- **Distribution:** 3% - 6%

**Analysis Points:**
- Better measure of operational efficiency than gross margin
- Compare to industry and analyze trends
- Operating leverage: Do margins expand as revenue grows?

---

#### EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue

**Target:** Varies by industry

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Retail:** 5% - 12%
- **Manufacturing:** 10% - 20%
- **Software/Services:** 20% - 40%
- **Distribution:** 4% - 8%

**Analysis Points:**
- Key metric for debt capacity
- Higher margins support higher leverage
- Compare to industry benchmarks

---

#### Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue

**Target:** Positive and stable

**Analysis Points:**
- Compare to industry average
- Analyze trend over time
- Consider impact of:
  - Interest expense (leverage)
  - Tax rate changes
  - One-time items

---

#### Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets

**Target:** > 5% (varies by industry and asset intensity)

**Interpretation:**
- **< 2%**: Low return on asset base
- **2% - 5%**: Moderate returns
- **5% - 10%**: Good returns
- **> 10%**: Strong returns (or asset-light business model)

---

#### Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity

**Target:** > 12% - 15%

**Interpretation:**
- **< 5%**: Weak returns to equity holders
- **5% - 12%**: Moderate returns
- **12% - 20%**: Good returns
- **> 20%**: Strong returns (or high leverage amplifying returns)

**Analysis Note:**
High ROE with high leverage may not be as attractive as moderate ROE with low leverage.

---

### Activity/Efficiency Ratios

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365

**Target:** Depends on payment terms and industry

**Typical Ranges:**
- **30-day terms:** DSO should be 35-45 days
- **60-day terms:** DSO should be 65-75 days
- **Net-10 or immediate:** DSO should be < 20 days

**Red Flags:**
- DSO significantly higher than payment terms (collection issues)
- Increasing DSO trend (deteriorating collections)
- DSO > 90 days (significant credit risk)

---

#### Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) = (Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

**Target:** Varies significantly by industry

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Perishable goods:** < 30 days
- **Retail:** 60-90 days
- **Manufacturing:** 60-120 days
- **Slow-moving goods:** > 120 days

**Analysis Points:**
- Compare to industry norms
- Increasing DIO may indicate obsolete inventory
- Consider seasonal patterns

---

#### Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) = (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

**Target:** Align with supplier terms

**Analysis Points:**
- Extending payables may indicate cash flow stress
- Paying too quickly may indicate unused trade credit
- Compare to DSO and DIO for cash conversion cycle

---

#### Cash Conversion Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO

**Target:** Lower is better (less cash tied up)

**Interpretation:**
- **Negative CCC**: Business collects cash before paying suppliers (very strong)
- **0-30 days**: Excellent cash efficiency
- **30-60 days**: Good cash efficiency
- **60-90 days**: Moderate - typical for many businesses
- **> 90 days**: Cash intensive - may need external financing

---

---

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Manufacturing
- **Key Metrics:** Capacity utilization, backlog, gross margin trends
- **Risks:** Customer concentration, competition, input cost volatility
- **Collateral:** Equipment (consider obsolescence), inventory (finished goods best)

### Distribution/Wholesale
- **Key Metrics:** Inventory turns, DSO, gross margin (typically low)
- **Risks:** Thin margins, supplier/customer concentration
- **Collateral:** Inventory (if not perishable), receivables

### Professional Services
- **Key Metrics:** Billable utilization, realization rates, DSO
- **Risks:** Key person dependency, client concentration
- **Collateral:** Receivables, possibly equipment

### Construction
- **Key Metrics:** Backlog, job profitability, bonding capacity
- **Risks:** Project completion risk, mechanics' liens, seasonality
- **Collateral:** Equipment, receivables (with contractor bond review)

### Healthcare
- **Key Metrics:** Same-store sales, EBITDA, payor mix
- **Risks:** Regulatory changes, reimbursement rates, competition
- **Collateral:** Equipment, real estate, receivables (verify payment from payors)

### Restaurants/Hospitality
- **Key Metrics:** Same-store sales, food cost %, labor cost %
- **Risks:** High failure rate, competition, location dependent
- **Collateral:** Real estate preferred, equipment has limited value

### Technology/Software
- **Key Metrics:** Recurring revenue %, churn rate, CAC/LTV ratios
- **Risks:** Rapid obsolescence, competition, cash burn
- **Collateral:** Often limited - focus on cash flow and growth trajectory
